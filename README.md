# to do list
* tune the first map to make more playable
* make some maps
* implement the "emergency self destruct" button
* exploding animation on death
* shaking screen when taking damage
* implement the birds that pop out to give you something more to do when "coasting"

* set up high score board, login, payment to register for high score board
* friends list to compete with only friends instead of the whole world

* the settings screen should let you pick a color for each of the 10 blocks
